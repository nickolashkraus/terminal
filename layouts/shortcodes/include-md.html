  Read the contents of a Markdown file and render as HTML.

  Removes the first line of the Markdown file if it starts with '#'.

  @param {string} path Path to the file.

  @example: {{% include-md "path/to/file" %}}

  NOTE: With Markdown notation, Hugo processes the shortcode before the page
  content is rendered by the Markdown renderer. This means, for instance, that
  Markdown headings inside a Markdown-notation shortcode will be included when
  invoking the TableOfContents method on the Page object.
